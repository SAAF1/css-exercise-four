# css-exercise-four
This exercise focused on the usage of media queries. In it I practiced my responsivity(TM). In other words I made the site go from mobile-

<img style="max-width:400px;" alt="mobile version" src=images/mobile.png>

to tablet sized.
<img style="max-width:400px;" alt="mobile version" src=images/ipad.png>

No code or cats were harmed in the process.
